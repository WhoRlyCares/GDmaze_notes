Gem - g from there. GBs - is still GumBalls. All fractions are 2 letter abbreviations. \* - for stars.
Per shards is cost of rare gumball shard - all dungeon shards are considered free in equations.

## Spending

### TLDR:
Sage is good, course it enables merc-camping what you need, cheaper then any other way.

### Spending exceptions:
- Traveling Merchant:
	- EP discount [GBs](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Talents#Detailed_Attributes_Table) when you have no other possible trials left.
	- [Orc](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Orc) math is complicated. Rare GBs shards are non affected by orc, no matter the stars you get less 2 on average. So in you get +2 Gladiator, +1 random at 5*. I don't think it's worth it. But jugging by spare Spartan orc 4* at day 1, will result in 2000+ common shards in 6 months.
	- If you want to play [Thee-eye king](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Three-eye_King) game from the start, you may consider buying him early. But speed running gets boring fast, and will eventually get you when shards for hidden GBs statues will be needed. 
- Dungeons
	- Not all dungeon gumballs are useful, but some definitely are. The fact that their shards excluded from Dungeon profitability makes Pirate Port, Skeleton Island,  Temple of Mars, City of Steam look less appealing then they are. Your endgame loops is  dependent on [Future-cat](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Future_Cat) and [Diviner](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Diviner)
- Gumballs
	- You will need Claw for Trials someday. And Odin streamlines a lot of runs at 600-900 Account start

## Merc Camp

Wall of text here, sorry. 

So what breaks merc camp:
- bad buys from shop - don't buy common GBs unless you trade them in merc camp
- circus quests - try to keep minimum amount of shards above circus deviations e.g. 38, this way in worst case you'll spend 2 carrots to fix it

What makes merc camp normal:
 - 2 exchanges for Gladiator
 - 4 exchanges of GBs which you farm with 7 shards per carrot. Eg [Zeros](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Zeros) and [Blue Shark ](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Blue_Shark) will have raid supports at good stars just by 80/80 SpaceCraft ruins.
 - Not exchaning above +1 star from base stars of GBs. There is no dungeon where you need it, only trials.

Exceptions:
	As usual 3-eyed, Demeter, Go-genious, Red Hood... All your rare OP gumballs. List very much depends on what you use on weekly basis. I was all over highscores with 2 star Go-genius, 4 star demeter.

Calculation example:
[Go_Genius_Jiang](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Go_Genius_Jiang) gives 5-6 **Attack** per activation and 4 **Power**, you can cast 3 times per 10 floors (15\*10=150/50=3) => **1,5**Attack **1,2**Power per floor if you never allow cd to overflow, and try to cast at floors with 6 mobs. Whenever you have dungeon with summons, you get much more attack. But power is stat that matter on floors 120 +.

# GD Theoretical Deepest Floor Run
## Don't wanna read, gimme numbers.
- [NuWa](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Nuwa) - 1.19 power/attack per floor with plain DPS. +stats from Wheel.
- [Divine](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Dragon) - 1.13 power with 300% DPS until diviners  "Cursed Eye" spoils debuff slot. Wheel set appears 25-30% less/later.
- So It's 357-339=**18** plain(before black mage and dungeon effects) power difference at **180** floor aka at 300 floors seen.

## Intro
- **TLDR - is bold.** Other text in this list is explanation attempt.
- **DeepRuns are just for lulz.** I haven't run deep-runs for quite a while, since they are not useful at all after 80/80 every dungeon and closing some honor quest. You can proof your self that 160 deep run is doable in every dungeon, except [Eden](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Eden%27s_Land), but since highscores don't give you anything you just do them to see for your self.
- **Casting is time consuming** Since you have to cast on average 5 spells per turn (e.g. curse every enemy, or stone skin + [Earth Spike](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Earth_Spike) for path 2 ranged ) floors after 120 take more and more time.
- **No tables there**, since it's all random. And depends on preference/dungeon.

## TLDR
- **Diviner is random.** [Diviner](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Diviner) proc is of supreme spoil is what matters in run the most. At high levels only stat which matter is power, so if you want to get to 180 floor+ you need ["Tears of Goddes"](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Temple_of_Mars#Spoils) which is 1 of 16 chance e.g. 6.25%.  "Bloodlust Axe" (Life steal 25%) makes 150 floor runs autopilot, but fails at deeper runs.
- **Divine dragon a bit random**. [It](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Dragon) is almost guaranteed Dragon Powers, since we talkin about 250 floors seen it's 13 Dragon Balls from talent only. So expect 4 wishes e.g. 12 choices seen, in 100% of runs. Since there are 13 repeatable wishes, you get what you need most of the time, but not at 100%
- **Bunny is demising returns** gumball, it gives you gems but probability nosedives after 12 or so gems, that's why wiki states it's limited. So it doesn't give enough against "More Gems Wish" . Only reason to run run him, when you need food over gems in short term. And he doesn't contribute to your DPS. It is mentioned in main table, because it is maximum greed, you get a lot of rewards (additional pots and gems) but can't go so deep.
- **NuWa works well with Demeter**  it's Active Skill not just activating harvest time passive more, it's giving you all sets [aka suits](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Equipment_Suits) when they paired, and a lot of lvl 6 slots. Nuwa's runs are [Wheel of Fortune](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_Suit) before second *PoE* in more than 50% cases.  So you get additional stats until you are forced to switch to [Dragon Scale (BoR set)](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Scale_Suit)  + [Wizard ](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Wizard%27s_Suit)
- **Challenge events break math.** I don't know all possible outcomes since wiki [pages](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Challenge_Maze_(Summer_2022)) doesn't list event equipment. E.g. all classes for free, allowed to drop Diviner since Go-Genious  on average was giving the same stats as best possible spoil. Or last event allowed to 5 classes at one run, which felt very strong.

## Proper explanation attempt.
Demeter is broken. I skip details, since you either see it yourself, or it will spoil gameplay. Basically getting 300+ power makes runs trivial, kill stuff with spell under 100, bless + ice-ice-ice boss, then equipment sets kick in and you have BoR and some  soft disables(curse then blind) at every floor. There are several ways to make demeter more broken:
- **faster skill charge**, only available when you don't need potion for run or in Eratia and Card Wonderland. In Card Wonderland you go infinite with go genius by casting skill more then once per floor.
- **more item drops** that's where Bunny and NuWa comes in. Both give you additional chance to proc harvest season, but NuWa is for deepRuns, while Bunny for more rewards per run runs.
- **earlier sets**  [Wheel of Fortune](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Wheel_of_Fortune_Suit) before fist PoE is insane. NuWa makes it possible, not frequent but you want jaw drop every time you get it. Problem is you can't forge it with adventurer titles unlike warrior/mage sets.
- **abusing challenges** last challenge allowed for quad stat growth: you get stats from native procs, from Harvest Active, from Mending Sky, from kills from demon(which Nuwa boosts too), and from wheel of fortune.

## Math?
- [Demeter](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Demeter) + [Diviner](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Diviner) + [NuWa](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Nuwa) is calculated like so every 5th floor with demeter you get 25-26 drops from active, nuwa gives you additional floor not calculated by demeter active meter every 5 floors. So expecting 10 drops per normal level, you can assume that harverst time passive generates 0,3 Power per normal floor seen, 0,83 power per 5 floors, and another 0,3 power per 5 floors. That's  1.19 power per floor. Attack, HP and MP doesn't matter but you get much more hp/mp since pots at 100% are pure +1.
- [Divine](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Dragon) looses exactly NuWa's active stats which is 0.06 power per floor, but bring insane [physical dps boost](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Evil_Dragon_Bloodline) until Diviner breaks it. it's hard to calculate how many times "Cursed Eye" with stop bleeding. In good case scenario - never, since it's rare slot which you just not roll. And missing Wheel Set is more probable, but again no idea how to math it.

## Intro
- Wiki is good, but a little outdated. Expect you to read though [terms](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Terms) and [FAQ](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/QandA)
- Game is quite old (5 years ++),  so there are a lot of events in the past, which dilute gumball pool. A lot of GBs make golden pots worse with each event, but introduce some broken soul-links. **Example**: Priestess, Red Hood, Sunflower considered OP in early years, but now they are outclassed by modern GBs.
- Guide is valid at 2024, any update can bring you another Demeter and make it a little obsolete.
- Writing this from my random notes, so can't reconstruct progress precisely.
- What to chain also describe what to spend excessive gems, if you have gem dungeon and progress and have 100+ spare gems.

## What to avoid
- Don't buy gumball shards from shop, unless you whaling
- Don't buy gumballs from shop->special gumballs, unless you know what you do.  Buying any before trials is questionable.
- Hoarding pots, you'll need around 60 pots for corresponding events, keeping more is a waste.
- Spending Moon and Sun keys. They make come handy later, or will be needed not to reset during sky event's. So don't spend them just because you can.


## Stage 0.1 Story pre AirShip
- **When** As you start the game. Before [sky](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Airship) airship unlock.
- **What to do** Just follow the 7 day event. And progress the story, as you can. Nothing rly matters, except what to avoid.
- **What to avoid** See default
- **What to chain** Gems. Upgrading alchemy fast is good.

## Stage 0.2 Story pre Ancient Arena 80/80
- **When** As keep going through story. Before you have stats to finish dp at [Ancient Arena](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Arena)
- **What to do** Aggressively reset sky, as soon as you met [Vincent](https://gdmaze.fandom.com/wiki/Sky_Exploration_Events#V) (monkey with a whip)
- **What to avoid** See default
- **What to chain** Pots as soon as soon as you done alchemy upgrades. 
- **Comment** Progress story, don't bang  dp stone walls until you got stats. A lot of them. 80/80 Ancient Arena is close around opening Hell Frontier + Some gem dungeons.

## Stage 1.1 Trials pre Eden
- **When** Trials unlocked. 
- **What to do** Keep aggressively resetting sky, while Novice answer is still valid. Start buying mazes for gems. You raid Ancient Arena for 2 gem GB shards, unless some good gumballs are at Mercenary Camp.
- **What to avoid** See default
- **What to chain** Pots until you got all 4 fractions rewards for 120 pots. Then babies.
- **Comment**: It's time to focus on 80/80 your dungeons. 

## Stage 1.2 Out of trials pre Eden
 - **When** You run out of doable trials, but not unlocked eden yet.
 - **What to do** It's time to get Claw and Machine Herald to enable more trials.
 - **What to avoid** You finally allowed to spend gems on  unlockiing -EP GBs (Magic Boy, Tripitaka, Red Hood...) when you see shards in shop. 
 - **What to chain** Finish babies, then whatever.

## Stage 1.3 Eden pre tech
 - **When** You unlocked Eden
 - **What to do** Keep buying dungeons.  Investigate trials, there are a lot of easy trials for hidden GBs.


## Stage 2. Eden pre Space
 - **When** Unlocked Tech Hall and Wonders later.
 - **What to do** Complete hidden quests. See  Try to make your fleets more even since space need all 4.
 - **What to do 2** Keep raiding ancient, until you 4 star most useful gem GBs from it. Try to understand how to manually speed run hell frontier for additional  daily shards.
Try to incorporate daily dragon wish for gems or Manually speedrunning Skeleton Island for Ghost Crystal. Ghost crystals sucks in 2024, so you probably get +2 gems for 40 mins of real time invested at best, which makes dragon wishing much better.

## Stage 3.1 Early Space
 - **When** Civilization 2 + Space M1
 - **What to do** I don't know.

## Stage 3.2 Space goes on.
 - **When** Space M2
 - **What to do** Nothing, you've finished all the dungeons and hidden quest. So you spacing for the sake of space, if you are interested. Otherwise GG
